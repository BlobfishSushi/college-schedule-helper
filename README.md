# College Schedule Helper

College Schedule Helper is a project that aims to assist college students with organizing their schedules for upcoming semesters. At any point in a student's assembling of a schedule, there's a myriad of issues to keep track of: such as the order in which classes are taken, the teachers that you take at that point in time, and what classes your friends are taking as well. College Schedule Helper solves this problem by providing one universal interface for organizing your schedule, so that organizing your classes for the coming year is as simple as selecting from a list and choosing from the various combinations of classes that you're provided with.

This wouldn't be much of a solution if it were only applicable to one college, so College Schedule Helper is being designed in such a way that anyone from any school can simply fork the project in order to have an interface usable to integrate with an API or database on their end!

College Schedule Helper uses Course.js for standardizing dealing with courses, and react-schedule for modularizing the actual schedule part of the application so that it's embeddable in any webpage you so wish. 

We currently aim to have a first version of the 3 parts of the project out by some time late march so that it's usable by this semester's schedule choosing cycle.
